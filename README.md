# iNoble-tasks


For the tables, I created them using MySQL. The two tables are Employee { EmpID, Name, Email and Mobile } and EmpExp { Id, Name, Years and EmpID } (Name here means a company name).

The index.js files are numbered according to each task.

Therefore, index,js is about creating a record. index2.js is about updating a record. index3.js is about finding all records whose employee name has an 'a' and are lazy loaded at 5 records at a time. Finally, index4.js is about selecting records by EmpID.
